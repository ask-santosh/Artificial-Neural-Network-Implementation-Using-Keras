# Artificial-Neural-Network-Implementation-Using-Keras
Create a simple 3 layers ANN by using keras.
### Problem Statement 
Due to this covid vaccination scenario here is a simple approach to find out the side effects of drugs . 
Age group 18-64 comes under younger age category and 65+ to onwards comes under older age category .
Younger age group do not have any side effects so given them label as 0 and older age group given as 1 as they have side effects .
Training and Test validation will be 80%-20%
